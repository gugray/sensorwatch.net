This section contains the stock firmware for Sensor Watch, as well as several prebuilt firmware images featuring an alternative set of watch faces. To flash one of these firmware images to your Sensor Watch, [follow the instructions here](/docs/firmware/flashing/).

### Prebuilt Firmwares

Note that each firmware comes in two flavors, depending on the color of your circuit board. This is because blue boards have a red/blue LED and green boards have a red/green LED, and the pins are swapped. No damage will result from loading the wrong firmware onto your board, but the LED colors will be wrong. 

Also note that all of these have the "Preferences" and "Time Set" screens at the end; for brevity they aren't included in this listing, but you will always have access to them.

Movement Standard
-----------------

This is the standard firmware for Movement. It's packed, but not jam-packed:

* Simple Clock - A basic clock with date for timekeeping.
* World Clock - You can configure this with a custom two-letter title and any time zone.
* Sunrise/Sunset - Local sunrise and sunset times.
* Moon Phase - Tonight's moon phase. (press Alarm to see days in the future)
* Stopwatch (by Wesley Ellis) - A simple stopwatch with one-second resolution.

Movement: Backer Edition (with temperature display)
---------------------------------------------------

**Required Sensor Board:** Temperature Sensor

The first Sensor Watch boards that shipped were with orders that automatically included a temperature sensor board. As such, the set of watch faces that shipped with those boards included a temperature display.

Post-campaign, the temperature sensor board was optional, so we replaced the temperature display with a stopwatch. If you bought a temperature sensor board and wish to have a temperature display, use this firmware; it's identical to the standard firmware, but replaces the stopwatch with a temperature display.

* Simple Clock - A basic clock with date for timekeeping.
* World Clock - You can configure this with a custom two-letter title and any time zone.
* Sunrise/Sunset - Local sunrise and sunset times.
* Moon Phase - Tonight's moon phase. (press Alarm to see days in the future)
* Temperature - As measured from the temperature sensor board. (Alarm toggles C or F)
